# CYFEx
An expansion for Choose Your Fighter for Caves of Qud spanning nearly 30 character choices so far, including contributions from Eule (use this mod to play a Tehuilotic protagonist!) Obviously this mod will not work if you aren't using Kernelmethod's excellent Choose Your Fighter mod.

Caves of Qud is a brilliantly deep and immersive game with surprisingly good visual style for a roguelike. There are dozens of different cute and visually striking silhouette-style player sprites to choose from, and they capture a wide variety of character and personality. Despite this, the one thing I have always felt it's missing is the lack of visually present mutations or cybernetics - other than the shell on the Dream Tortoise and the torso of an errant Hindren, there are no player sprites to represent the vast amount of many-limbed horrors mutant players often build, or the dystopic cyborgs Truekin players put together. Thus, CYFEx - Choose Your Fighter Expansion - is born. As of right now, there is no Steam upload as it is not yet ready - I plan to make many sprites yet. Feel free to DM me, comment or open an issue with character build requests!

## Installation
As of right now there is no Steam upload as it is waiting on much more work. However, it is available to run as-is and compatible with 206.37 as long as you have the appropriate download of Choose Your Fighter (the current Steam release should be fine). There should not be many things that will break this mod's specific compatibility, as it has its own references - as long as the base CYF mod keeps the same namespace it should remain compatible. Install this in your offline mod folder.

## Recommendation
There is a lot of color design in many player sprites (not just in this mod but in others as well) and the "Color player's @ based on HP Level" option can wash them out at full health. Turning this off will improve the look of a lot of sprites. 
- It can be found in Options -> Overlay UI -> User Interface -> "Color player's @ based on HP Level"

## Outside Contributors:
- Eule: Tehuilotic sprite and Exile mutants, truekin, and wights
- KafkaExMachina: Catgirls
