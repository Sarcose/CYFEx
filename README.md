Caves of Qud is a brilliantly deep and immersive game with surprisingly good visual style for a roguelike. There are dozens of different cute and visually striking silhouette-style player sprites to choose from, and they capture a wide variety of character and personality. Despite this, the one thing I have always felt it's missing is that the lack of visually present mutations - other than the shell on the Dream Tortoise and the torso of an errant Hindren, there are no player sprites to represent the vast amount of many-limbed horrs mutant players often build, or the dystopic cyborgs Truekin players put together. Thus, CYFEx - Choose Your Fighter Expansion - is born. As of right now, there is no Steam upload as it is not yet ready - I plan to make many sprites yet. Feel free to DM me, comment or open an issue with character build requests!
